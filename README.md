### About Me
I am a sophomore at IE University pursuing a Bachelor in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, graduating in 2028. My academic work and projects focus on areas such as data analysis, simulation and modeling, and machine learning foundations. I am gaining hands-on experience through coursework, personal projects, and research in the Robotics & AI Lab, where I work with Python, Arduino, and robotic simulation tools.

Alongside my technical skills in C, Python, Java, and cloud-based tools, I bring strong problem-solving and collaboration abilities developed through both academic and professional experiences. I am eager to apply my knowledge to real-world challenges and contribute as a software engineering or AI intern in Summer 2026.
